# Survey Cloud Architecture-the-case-of-Amazon-AWS
Survey

I created a report on how Amazon implements its Amazon Web Service (AWS) through cloud architecture. 

I also analyzed on various services used by AWS to enhance its cloud platform by selecting specific 
applications under storage (S3, Glacier), Compute and Networking (EC2, VPC) and Analytics (EMR, kinesis). 

The report also focuses on signing and authentication features used in S3.
